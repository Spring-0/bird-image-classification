# Bird Image Classification

This project uses Tensorflow and Keras to fine-tune the EfficientNet0 model for classifying images as either "bird" or "not bird". The project leverages transfer learning from EfficientNetB0 to speed up the training process, and improve accuracy.

## Technologies Used

* Tensorflow
* Keras
